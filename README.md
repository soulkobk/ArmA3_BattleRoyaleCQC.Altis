# ArmA3_BattleRoyaleCQC.Altis
 Arma 3 Battle Royale CQC
 
 This version was coded/scripted from scratch in July 2021 (with some of my old code from the legacy version which was ported from 'BR Ghost Hotel' scripted by Lyric).
 
 Is there any interest in A3 Battle Royale any more? Doubt it... but this was more a personal endevour to achive something that I struggled to do many years ago whilst learning how to script/code for Arma 3. This version was scripted/coded/tested/debugged/finalized locally all within 4 days, it was also tested in a continuous loop on a dedicated server for over 20 rounds which ran flawlessly. Will there be bugs? not sure, maybe?.. if so, just report them.
 
 All configuration is within the 'ArmA3_BattleRoyaleCQC.Altis\initServer.sqf' file and for the loot tables, see the 'ArmA3_BattleRoyaleCQC.Altis\functions\server\fn_lootInit.sqf' file.
 
 The mission is set up to run on a dedicated server.
 
 Enjoy.
